# Colour Profles for Raspberry Pi Cameras

This repository contains DCP colour profiles for Raspberry Pi cameras. Currently we only have profiles for the imx477 (HQ Cam). There is a basic profile as used by the PyDNG tool, but also some larger (improved) profiles using look-up tables.

Thanks to Jack Hogan for creating them.
